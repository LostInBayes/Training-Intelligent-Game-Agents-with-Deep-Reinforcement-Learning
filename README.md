# Training-Intelligent-Game-Agents-with-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Material for PyData London 2019 talk

Python3.6/3.7 should work
Tensorflow-1.13 (We will not be using Tensorflow 2.0 for this tutorial but I intend to make copies of the notebook rewritten
with Tensorflow 2.0 before the end of July 2019. Whilst a familiarity with deep learning is expected for the talk if you are installing tensorflow for the first time please install the CPU only version).

In a virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
